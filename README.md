# Webbed-Audio-AIP
## Webbed Audio AIP (Application In Parts)
- An AIP for Webbed Audio app. Great for developing.

The purpose of this program is to be able to download media files, specifically audio files from free audiobook websites. This is to allow for remote listening without any current internet connection as well as to enable other media features that aren't avaliable or work poorly on the sites. Some examples of problems I've encountered on sites such as these are as follows:

* Listening progress isn't saved.
> - Solution: Transcribe the media files from current format to m4a and then to m4b. This can be done through using command line tools or itunes to AAC (AAC == M4A) and the using the AAC to Audiobook Creator app.
* Basic media buttons are not prevelant such as:
    + On mobile: Volume modifier removed.
    + Download track option has been removed.
    + Autoplay next track  not prevelant.
    + Repeat or Shuffle also not avaliable.
* Track slider works poorly and doesn't display track time at thumb before navigation (or thumb release).
* Additional track info that is often avaliable in mp3 files such as:
    + Author.
    + Title.
    + Series or Album.
    + Number.
    + Publisher.
> Solution: Use VLC, great app. All since last dot can be solved. Both mobile and desktop.
* 30 seconds + / -  
* And much more.

With this project I want to make it easier to listen to free audiobooks from websites such as these. I also want to have these feautures avaliable to me as I often listen myself (one of my favourite passtimes). Please comment on any features that are missing or that you think would make this app better. Also comment on sites that you want the app to work on that it currently do not.

> If your desired audiobook can't be found on the belowed listed sites I heard a rumor of something akin to the sound of "Pirat Baaej" wait no [AudiobookBay](http://audiobookbay.fi/) and things like [qBittorrent](https://www.qbittorrent.org/). This is merely an observation not a recommendation nor should it be by anyone if you don't have proper web protection and tech savvy. Use ad blocker, tracker blocker, vpn, firewalls, antivirus. The whole deal. Just as a general internet privacy tip of course (which you should not follow and I didn't recommend).

> Note: This project contains methods to handle websites similair to [Golden Audiobooks](https://goldenaudiobooks.com/), [101 Audiobooks](https://101audiobooks.com/) and [FullLengthAudiobooks](https://fulllengthaudiobooks.com/), the project were also tested on these sites. 

## Application Outline

This application should through the fewest clicks and least effort possible be easily downloaded and be useable in a timely manner. 

The platform should allow users to download the audio media from the above sites. The user should also be able to choose an output folder of their choice, see progress of file downloads and quickly navigate to the chosen folder.

The app should also allow the user to schedule MP3 files in a selected folder to be remade into M4B files to be able to save their listening progress. Both avaliable as an option on download screen as well as at a later stage in case of desired M4b file format on audio media files outside the app. 

Possible future ideas and cool features could be:
* If possible try making a mobile version when done with desktop version.
* To implement a changing tips screen concerning listening to audiobooks without much capital avaliable.. ahem.. 
* Allow the user a feature to automatically fetch track data from online sources. (Don't even know if this is feasable).
   
To really excell the app into the best version of itself:
* Make the app smoother through animation transitions.
* More options.
* Cloud syncing files and downloading more easily from one device to the other.

### Good luck me don't know how I'm gonna do the MP3 -> M4A -> M4B conversion.
